Quiz 1

Find the total amount of poster_qty paper ordered in the orders table.

SELECT SUM(poster_qty) 
FROM orders;

Find the total dollar amount of sales using the total_amt_usd in the orders table.

SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd) 
from orders;

Find the total amount spent on standard_amt_usd and gloss_amt_usd paper for each order in the orders table. This should give a dollar amount for each order in the table.

SELECT standard_amt_usd+gloss_amt_usd AS gloss&standard
FROM orders;

Find the standard_amt_usd per unit of standard_qty paper. Your solution should use both an aggregation and a mathematical operator.

SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) AS average_standard
from orders;

Quiz 2

When was the earliest order ever placed? You only need to return the date.

SELECT MIN(occurred_at)

ORDER BY occurred_at asc
LIMIT 1;

Via the video, you might be interested in how to calculate the MEDIAN. Though this is more advanced than what we have covered so far try finding - what is the MEDIAN total_usd spent on all orders?

SELECT PERECENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amt_usd) FROM orders;

Instructors code:

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT total_amt_usd

SELECT DISTINCT a.name, r.name
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id=s.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id=s.region_id

GROUP BY 1

Write a query to display the number of orders in each of three categories, based on the total number of items in each order. The three categories are: 'At Least 2000', 'Between 1000 and 2000' and 'Less than 1000'.

SELECT total, CASE WHEN total >= 2000 THEN 'At least 2000' WHEN total BETWEEN 1000 and 2000 AND total !=2000 THEN 'Between 1000 and 2000' ELSE 'Less than 1000' END

We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on the amount associated with their purchases. The top level includes anyone with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd. The second level is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest level is anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_lifetime_value, CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'First Level' WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd)  BETWEEN 100000 and 200000  THEN 'Second level' ELSE 'Third level' END

We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_lifetime_value, CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'First Level' WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd)  BETWEEN 100000 and 200000  THEN 'Second level' ELSE 'Third level' END

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top sales people first in your final table.

SELECT s.name, COUNT(*) num_ords,
     CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 THEN 'top'
     ELSE 'not' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id 
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first in your final table. You might see a few upset sales people by this criteria!

SELECT s.name, COUNT(*), SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent, 
     CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'top'
     WHEN COUNT(*) > 150 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'middle'
     ELSE 'low' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id 
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
